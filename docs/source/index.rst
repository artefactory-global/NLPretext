Welcome to NLPretext's documentation!
========================================

The NLPretext library aimed to be a meta-library to be used to help you get started on handling your NLP use-case preprocessing.


# Installation

Beware, this package has been tested on Python `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10` & `3.11` and will probably not be working under python **2.7** as **Python2.7** EOL is scheduled for December 2019.

To install this library you should first clone the repository:

pip install nlpretext
